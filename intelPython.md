# How to get a huge speedup with Machine Learning/Data Science Tasks on computers with an Intel CPU

## In this article, I wil show you how you can get a huge speedup for Machine Learning/Data Science tasks using Intel Python. 

## What is Intel Python?
Intel python is a version of Python that is optimized to run on Intel CPUs. This optimization yields significantly faster speeds when compared to normal Python, especially in Machine Learning/Data Science tasks. 

## Windows installation
1. Download the files from [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/distribution-for-python.html)
2. Extract the zip file downloaded
3. Open command promt as administrator and change directory to the location of the extracted folder and type `cd intelpython3`
4. type `setup_intel_python.bat`
5. COMMAND TO ACTIVATE

## macOS installation
1. Download the tarball from [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/distribution-for-python.html)
2. Extract the tarball file downloaded with `tar -xvzf<NAME_OF_TARBALL>`
3. type `cd intelpython3`
4. type `bash setup_intel_python.sh`
5. COMMAND TO ACTIVATE
