## Welcome to my site

To install Taruri on Mac, you will need to first install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't have it installed alredy. You can do that by running: 
```shell 
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
Once you have homebrew installed, you need to install the Xcode command line tools. That can be done with the following command:
```shell 
$ xcode-select --install
```

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
